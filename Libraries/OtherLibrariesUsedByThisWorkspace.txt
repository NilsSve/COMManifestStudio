The workspace uses the DUF (The Database Update Framework) project as a library.
Both DUF and COMManifestStudio uses the following three libraries:
- DFAbout
- RDCToolsLib
- vwin32fh

Using libraries in GIT is the same as using submodules. However, 
if those three libraries/submodules would be used/defined by the COMManifestStudio as well,
GIT would get very confused and it would lead to an update/commit nightmare.

For that reason the three libraries/submodules "DFAbout", "RDCToolsLib" and "vwin32fh",
are ONLY used once and that is in the DUF library.
If you check the DUF library it also has a folder named "Libraries" and there the three
libraries/submodules resides.

For the DataFlex compiler this doesn't really matter, as it will still find everything it needs
to be able to compile properly.
