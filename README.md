## Initializing the cloned repository:

After cloning the repository, start the Studio with Administrator rights and compile the "VmdCmdUtil.src" program. Then restart the Studio without Administrator rights and compile the main app: "COMManifestStudio.src".

IMPORTANT NOTE: The programs needs to compiled as 32-bit! Else the intercommunication with COM components won't work.
